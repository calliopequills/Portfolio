TOLET GLOBE WORKSHOP
DAY 1 



Introduction

Welcome to Day 1 of our workshop, where we'll be focusing on interview preparation skills. Today is all about setting a strong foundation for your interview’s success. We'll cover everything from researching the company and understanding the job role to anticipating common interview questions and crafting your responses.

Let's get started and make sure you're prepared for every step! 


________________________________________

1.	Pre-interview preparation.

Pre-interview preparation is the first and foremost step of being ready for the interview. Here are a few tips which you can follow to ace the interview:


(i) Research your company and the required role.
 
Learn about the company and the vacant job post. It implies visiting the company website, checking the financial status of the company, browsing its social media or LinkedIn account and reading about its competitors as well. Also, make sure that your skill set matches the job requirements. 


(ii) Reach out to seniors or employees of the company for feedback.

The next step is to contact the senior employees of the company to have an overall understanding of the company environment. This will help to increase familiarity with the organization as well as understanding the work culture, ethics, rules and policies. Taking advice from other employees will assist you in forming a mental image of the company and being aware of the reality before you join. 

(iii) Review common interview questions

Then, examine the frequently asked interview questions. It will guide you in framing your answer in an appropriate way before your interview, as well as it will also help you be prepared to handle different questions with confidence. Being prepared in advance also depicts that you are passionate about the job and the company. It indicates that you have done your research and are well equipped.

(iv) Connect on LinkedIn and tailor your answers and mindset as per company requirements.

Expand your LinkedIn connections and shape your responses as per the company’s requirements. In today's world, networking has become crucial for job opportunities. Having more LinkedIn connections will aid in bringing more job opportunities and gaining insights into various other such companies. You can increase your connections by upgrading your profile, joining LinkedIn groups, posting content regularly and promoting your profile. The more followers you have, the more you will appear at the top of the search engine. This is an additional benefit derived.

(v) Review your notes, resume, cover letter, job description, and company/industry summaries.

Verify your notes, company summary, resume and cover letter with the job description to make sure that the job requirements and skills available complement each other. Revise your resume and cover letter so that you're aware of all the details which might be asked. Be prepared for the topics that are mentioned in your resume. If your resume covers a skillset which you have learnt, let's say - Cost Management Accounting, then you should also be aware of what you have learned in the course so that you can explain it better.    

(vi) Prepare an appropriate interview outfit. 

Arrange a suitable attire for the interview. Be ready with the clothing - shirt, pants, tie, blazer, if required, dress as well as shoes and socks. Keep the clothes ironed before going for the interview. Make sure that it is comfortable and fits you well. 

(vii) Have the following items prepared: copies of your resume, work portfolio, copies of cover letter, etc.

Organize all these items one day prior to the interview- copies of resume, cover letter and work portfolio. Have multiple copies of each item so that if by any chance one copy is lost/torn then you have additional copies with you. Also, during the interview, there might be two or three interviewers in the panel so having extra copies is better so that it can be distributed to everyone for assessment.

(i) Evaluate your performance. Did any questions stump you?

The first step after the interview would be to gauge your performance. Assess how well you have handled the interview. Self-assessment will help you learn from past experience. Ask yourself questions as to how well you answered questions which were posed to you. Was there any question which you were unsure of and, if yes, then how can you structure your answer properly? Here are a few examples of self-evaluating questions:
1.	Did I maintain eye contact throughout the interview?

4. PERSONALITY-RELATED ASPECTS IMPORTANT FOR INTERVIEW 

Research conducted by psychologist Albert Mehrabian highlights the significant impact of non-verbal communication on our interactions. According to his findings, words only constitute 7% of communication, vocal elements such as intonation make up 38% but non-verbal cues like facial expressions, gestures, and posture account for 55%.
Non-verbal communicative gestures are important because they often convey more about a person than their spoken words. Your physical demeanor, personal energy, and posture during an interview can convey a wealth of information about your personality and suitability for the role. These non-verbal cues provide insight into your confidence, sincerity, and level of engagement, giving interviewers an impression of you as a potential hire. Here are key personality-related aspects that are crucial during an interview:

(i) Sit at the Back of the Chair
A very natural thing for people to do is slouch in a chair or fold their arms making them look smaller. When you do this, you give the impression that you are nervous.
How you appear in your seat is important. Your back should be aligned against the back of the chair. Your shoulders must be down, and your chin must be parallel to the floor.
A strong, disciplined posture is part of your body language and leaves a lasting impression of professionalism on the recruiter. 
(ii) Lean Forward Slightly
  Open up your body, don’t cross your legs or fold your arms but lean slightly forward from the waist and this shows the interviewer that you’re interested and involved in the conversation. Smile and nod when appropriate. 
(iii) Keep Both Feet on the Ground
Avoid crossing your legs at the knees, which can seem defensive, or placing an ankle over one knee, which can seem overly casual. Keep both feet grounded or cross your ankles to appear confident and professional. Avoid moving your feet or legs frequently, which can be distracting and a sign of anxiety.
(iv) Tilt Your Head Slightly
Tilting the head while the interviewer speaks indicates that you are listening intently, and are actively engaging and thinking about the subject matter. It makes you appear friendly and engaged. Don't look down unless you’re writing notes or referencing your resume.
(v) Get your eye contact right 
Interviewees often avoid the gaze of the interviewer or they look down. Frequently looking away indicates that you are distracted, uncomfortable, or disengaged. By looking at the interviewer’s eyes you’re asserting your confidence and trustworthiness. Instead of staring at the interviewer, alternate your gaze between the left eye, and the right eye, maybe every three seconds. For a panel interview, make sure you look at everybody but your focus should be on the person asking you the questions or speaking at that time.
(vi) Proper handshake
Unspoken words initiate conversation in any social or professional get-together. A professional handshake may establish rapport between people during an in-person interaction.  Initiate the handshake, and match the interviewer’s grip.  Repeat their name, make eye contact with the person, and offer a sincere smile to show your feelings about the interaction. 
(vii) Be active during the interview
Full participation in your interview as an active listener serves two purposes. First, it conveys your interest in the position to the interviewer. Second, active listening helps you pick up on clues about company culture that will let you know whether the position is a good fit for you. Ask open-ended follow-up questions when you have the opportunity. The interview should feel like a conversation.  
Keep your hand gestures steady and only to emphasize a point. Mirroring hand movements or posture gestures are effective techniques. Wait ten seconds, before you do it yourself and you can also mirror the volume of speech. People trust those who are similar to themselves and you’re more likely to build a rapport with them.

5. Importance of Sitting Properly in an Interview 

First impressions play a vital role in an interview, as we now know that nonverbal cues can account for up to 55% of communication. Proper posture and body language not only influence how you are viewed but also demonstrate your confidence and enthusiasm for the position. Studies show that up to 90% of interviewers form their opinion within the first few minutes, making it crucial to convey confidence and professionalism from the start. This combination of positive nonverbal communication and self-assured demeanor sets a strong, professional tone for the entire interview, greatly impacting its outcome.

(i) First Impressions

When you first sit down, the interviewer immediately forms an impression of you based on your physical presence. A proper sitting posture can convey professionalism and attentiveness, which are key factors in making a positive first impression. Sitting upright with your back straight against the chair communicates that you are alert and prepared. This posture suggests that you are taking the interview seriously, which can make a lasting impression on the interviewer. 

A slouched or relaxed posture, on the other hand, might give the impression that you are indifferent or unprepared. The importance of first impressions in an interview cannot be overstated, as they can significantly influence the interviewer's perception and set the stage for the rest of the conversation. Therefore, maintaining a proper sitting posture from the moment you enter the room is crucial for establishing a positive rapport with the interviewer. In essence, your sitting posture serves as an immediate non-verbal cue that can either enhance or undermine the professional image you wish to project. 

(ii) Nonverbal cues affect the interviewer's perception.

Positive nonverbal communication can enhance the interviewer's perception of you, making you appear more competent and likable. Conversely, negative nonverbal cues can detract from your verbal responses. For example, fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or crossing your arms can be perceived as signs of nervousness, defensiveness, or disinterest. These negative impressions can undermine even the most well-prepared answers. Therefore, being mindful of your nonverbal communication, including your sitting posture, is essential for conveying the right messages to the interviewer. 

Nonverbal cues extend beyond posture to include facial expressions, gestures, and eye contact. A genuine smile, for example, can communicate warmth and approachability, while maintaining steady eye contact can demonstrate confidence and engagement.  Hence,  nonverbal signals are paramount to reinforcing the positive attributes you want to convey during an interview. 

(iii) Demonstrates confidence and enthusiasm.

Confidence and enthusiasm are qualities that employers look for in candidates, and your sitting posture can help convey these traits. Sitting upright with a slight lean forward demonstrates that you are engaged and eager to participate in the conversation. This posture indicates that you are confident in your abilities and excited about the opportunity to join the company. 

Your sitting posture should be part of a broader strategy to project enthusiasm and readiness for the job. This includes being proactive in your responses, showing genuine interest in the company, and asking insightful questions. Together, these elements create a compelling narrative that you are not only a qualified candidate but also a passionate and committed one.

6. Tips for Showcasing Your Personality 

Showcasing your personality during interviews is crucial as it helps employers assess your fit with the company culture and dynamics along with giving them a better understanding of your mindset and perspective. Here are some tips to effectively convey your personality:

(i) Practice Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions are a staple in interviews as they help employers understand how you have handled various situations in the past. Practicing responses to these questions allows you to articulate your experiences clearly and confidently. 
Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers, providing specific examples that highlight your personality traits and skills. For instance, when asked about a time you demonstrated leadership, you could describe a situation where you led a team project, the tasks involved, the actions you took to guide the team, and the successful outcome of the project. 

Practicing these responses helps you become more comfortable with discussing your experiences and ensures that you can showcase your personality effectively. 

(ii) Mock Interviews

Mock interviews are an excellent way to practice showcasing your personality in a realistic setting. These simulated interviews help you become familiar with the interview process and receive feedback on your performance. Pay attention to how you present yourself and the aspects of your personality that come through during the mock interview. 
Mock interviews also help reduce anxiety by giving you a chance to practice in a low-stakes environment. Additionally, mock interviews can help you develop strategies for handling unexpected questions or situations, further enhancing your confidence and adaptability. 


(iii) Be Authentic

Authenticity is crucial in an interview. Trying to present a false version of yourself can come across as disingenuous and can be exhausting to maintain. Instead, be true to who you are and let your genuine personality shine through. Authenticity helps build trust with the interviewer and can make you more memorable. It also ensures that you and the employer are a good fit, leading to better job satisfaction and performance if you are hired. 

This not only increases your chances of making a favorable impression but also helps you find a role that truly aligns with who you are.

(iv) Body Language

Body language is a powerful tool for showcasing your personality. Maintaining good eye contact, smiling, and using open gestures can convey friendliness and approachability. Be mindful of your posture; sitting up straight and leaning slightly forward shows engagement and interest. Avoid crossing your arms or appearing too rigid, as this can come across as defensive or unapproachable. 

Your facial expressions also play a significant role in conveying your personality. A genuine smile can make you seem more likable and approachable, while a serious or stern expression might be appropriate when discussing more serious topics. Being aware of your body language and making conscious adjustments can help you present yourself in the best possible light. Furthermore, body language can complement your verbal responses, creating a cohesive and convincing presentation of your personality. 

(v) Dress Appropriately

Dressing appropriately for an interview is a reflection of your personality and your understanding of the company's culture. Research the company's dress code beforehand and choose an outfit that aligns with it. Dressing well shows that you respect the opportunity and have made an effort to present yourself professionally. It also gives you confidence, which can positively affect your overall demeanor during the interview. 
 Dressing appropriately not only demonstrates that you have done your homework but also that you respect the company’s culture and values. Your choice of attire can also serve as a subtle indicator of your personality, allowing you to express yourself within the bounds of professional expectations.

7. Tell Me About Yourself.

Answering the question "Tell me about yourself" sets the tone for the entire interview and is often considered the most important question one faces. So, to make a positive impression your response needs to be concise and relevant, providing the interviewer with a clear understanding of who you are; not personally but professionally. 
It is also important to not just summarise your resume while answering about yourself but interpret it in a fashion that favours you.

We can achieve that unique narrative by following the ten key points.

(i) Introduce Briefly

The first thing to do is to introduce yourself briefly. 
Your introduction is your first opportunity to make a strong impression. A brief and focused introduction will give the interviewer a clear picture of your educational and professional background.

(ii) Review the Job Description and Align Your Skills with It

Having a thorough understanding of the job you are applying for and aligning your narrative in a way that convinces the interviewer that you have the specific qualifications they are seeking.

This can be done by carefully reviewing the job description before the interview. Identify the key skills and qualifications required and match your skills and experiences to these requirements.

(iii) Mention Relevant Experiences and Achievements

Relevant experiences demonstrate your capability to perform the job, while any mention of achievements would show the determination you hold.
This can be done by discussing your previous roles and the responsibilities you handled and highlighting your key achievements.

(iv) Relate Your Current Internship/ Education to the Open Role

You can do this by discussing your current Job/Internship responsibilities and the similarities between your position as an intern and the new role. 

Relating your current Internship to the open role helps the interviewer see a clear connection between your current responsibilities and the requirements of the new position. Discussing your current job responsibilities provides context for your skills and experiences. It shows the interviewer what you are capable of handling on a day-to-day basis.

(v) Highlight How Your Experience Aligns with the New Role

Identify the key aspects of the position you are applying for and provide examples from your past experiences that match the required aspects. This will emphasise that you are a good fit for the position and can quickly adapt to their needs which significantly increases your chances of being considered for that position.

(vi) Provide Quantifiable Outcomes to Illustrate Your Strengths

Quantifiable outcomes provide concrete evidence of your achievements and demonstrate the impact of your work. So it is important to use numbers, percentages, and other metrics to quantify your work’s progress.

(vii) Use Specific Examples to Demonstrate Your Skills and Achievements

A short introduction is desired but in certain cases, one might get the chance to elaborate on his experience much more. So, read the room and grab such a chance to demonstrate your skills and achievements. Share detailed stories of your accomplishments and Explain the context, your actions, and the results. These specific examples will make your achievements more credible and help the interviewer visualize your contributions.

(viii) Highlight Your Personality

Highlighting your personality helps the interviewer see you as a versatile individual and determine if you would be a good choice for the organization.

And how do we do that?  
By sharing hobbies and interests that showcase your intellectual merit and personal discipline.

(ix) Focus on Strengths and Abilities with Examples

Identify your top strengths that are relevant to the job and provide specific examples that demonstrate these strengths.
Focusing on your strengths allows you to present yourself as a capable candidate who can add value to the organization.

(x) Never Share Irrelevant Information

Finally, you must remember to never share irrelevant information such as discussing personal life details and sharing sensitive information or trying to establish any casual conversations. 

Irrelevant information will have a negative impact on your overall presentation by distracting your interview from your professional qualifications and making you appear unfocused.



Answering this question effectively requires careful preparation so it is beneficial to craft a personalized response using these points and practice it thoroughly for a better execution.
