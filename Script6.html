Day 6 : Documentation and Company Overview                                                       

PART 1
Welcome to the Day 6 of our workshop! In today’s session, we’re diving into the essentials of preparing effective documentation for a company when applying for interviews. We’ll cover why documentation is crucial, how to research the company, and how to tailor your materials to meet the needs of your audience. Let’s get started!
1.	Planning and research
1.1 Define the purpose and audience for your documentation.
Before you begin, it’s important to understand why you’re creating this documentation. In many companies, Before the interview, we need to research on company profile, financials, and overview of the Job description. For interviews, preparing documentation might include your CV, academic transcripts, and other essential documents. While not every company requires extensive documentation, many employers, especially those in MBA programs or higher-level positions, do.
Your documentation will be reviewed by hiring managers or recruiters. It’s important to understand who will be reading your documents and what they expect. Tailoring your language and level of detail to meet their expectations is key.
For example, if you’re applying to a company known for its innovative culture, highlighting your creative achievements might be beneficial. Conversely, if the company values technical expertise, focus on your relevant skills and experiences.
1.2 Gather basic information about your company: name, founding date, and location.
To create effective documentation, gather comprehensive information about the company:
Here are some of the key factors to find out from your research:
●	 The official and complete name of the company as registered legally.
●	The exact date or at least the year when the company was founded. This helps provide historical context.
●	What the company does and the industry it operates in
●	Include the headquarters location and any other significant office locations if applicable. This gives an idea of the company's geographical presence.
●	The approximate team size
●	The company’s history, major successes and defining moments
●	The company’s customers/clients or target audience
●	The industry the company operates in
●	Products or services that the company has recently launched
●	The company’s mission, aims, objectives or goals
How to Research Companies
Here are some strategies for researching a company:
●	Visit the Company Website: Check the home page, 'About Us' section, and 'Meet The Team' page. Look for their mission statement and recurring themes.
●	Check Social Media: Follow their accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Social media can provide insights into their culture, recent news, and key players.
1.3 Brainstorm key points you want to cover
When brainstorming key points to cover about a company, focusing on company history, mission, and products/services provides a well-rounded overview. You should include how the company was founded, including any key individuals involved and the initial motivation behind starting the company. Mention the company’s mission statement, which defines its core purpose and the value it aims to deliver to its customers or clients. Provide an overview of the main products or services offered by the company. Include details about their features, benefits, and how they meet customer needs.
1.4 Research your target audience's preferences and needs.
Finally, consider how your audience prefers to receive information. Do they prefer written documents, visual presentations, or interactive formats? Tailor your content to align with their preferences and needs.

 2: Outline Creation
 2.1 Introduction
The introduction serves as the entry point for readers, providing an overview of the documentation's purpose and scope. It should briefly describe what the document covers and its relevance to the audience. A well-crafted introduction sets the tone for the rest of the document and engages readers from the outset. 
 2.2 Company History
The company history section delves into the origins and development of the organization. This section should highlight key milestones, significant achievements, and pivotal moments that have shaped the company. It provides context and background, helping readers understand the company's journey and evolution.
 2.3 Products/Services
In the products/services section, detailed descriptions of the company's offerings are provided. Each product or service should be explained clearly, including its features, benefits, and unique selling points. This section should be comprehensive yet concise, ensuring readers can easily grasp the value proposition of each offering.
 2.4. Mission and Vision
The mission and vision section articulates the company's core values, goals, and long-term aspirations. It reflects the organization's philosophy and strategic direction. This section is crucial for aligning readers with the company's purpose and motivating stakeholders by showcasing the bigger picture.
2.5. Team
Highlighting the team introduces the key individuals behind the company. This section should include brief biographies of founders, executives, and other important team members. Emphasizing their expertise, experience, and contributions helps build credibility and trust.
 2.6. Contact Information
The contact information section provides essential details for readers to get in touch with the company. This includes addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social media links. Ensuring this information is easily accessible encourages engagement and communication with the audience.
Why Create an Outline?
An outline serves as a roadmap for your writing, helping you to stay focused, ensure logical flow, and avoid writer's block. It also enables you to visualize the overall structure of your content, making it easier to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.
Step 1: Define Your Purpose and Scope
Before creating an outline, define the purpose and scope of your writing. What is the main topic? What are the key points you want to cover? Who is your target audience?
Step 2: Brainstorm and Research
Brainstorm ideas, research your topic, and gather relevant information. Take notes, organize your thoughts, and identify key themes and subtopics.
Step 3: Determine the Structure
Determine the structure of your outline. Will it be chronological, thematic, or hierarchical? Choose a structure that suits your content and audience.
Step 4: Create Headings and Subheadings
Create headings and subheadings that reflect the main topics and subtopics. Use clear and concise language, and ensure each heading and subheading is descriptive and accurate.
Step 5: Add Bullet Points and Details
Add bullet points and details under each heading and subheading. Break down complex information into smaller, manageable chunks.
Step 6: Review and Revise
Review your outline, revise as necessary, and ensure it meets your purpose and scope.
 Conclusion
By dividing the documentation into these key sections and allocating specific time estimates for each, you can create a structured and efficient outline. This approach ensures that all critical aspects of the company are covered comprehensively while managing time effectively. The resulting documentation will be well-organized, informative, and engaging, serving its intended purpose effectively.

 3: Writing Content
Start with the Introduction: An introduction to the company profile is essential so that you can reveal the company information to your target audience. They should be aware of the company details and get an overview of it. Make sure to add the company’s history, members, mission/vision, and its products and services. This information will provide your target audience with a summary of the company environment and work culture. 
Move on to Company History: As mentioned above, first mention the company history which means describing how and why the company started, its values, key events that shaped the company, and other past notable events. The history of the company is not just a timeline of its inception but it is to display the characteristics of the company. The information that should be included in the company history is:
1.	Why the company was founded- This question is answered by explaining the mission and vision of the company. It explains the challenges that existed in the environment and how your company came up with steps to overcome those challenges. 
2.	Founders- Mention the people who played a crucial role in forming the organization. List the key role that they played and how their contribution shaped the company. 
3.	Values of the organization- Clearly define the values the company has formed which helps in identifying the brand value of the organization. 
4.	Key events- Add any significant events which helped in establishing the organization. Mention those milestones which marked the growth and success of the organization.  
5.	Awards and Recognition- Include the awards and achievements of the company which will prove the company's ethics and work culture. 
Describe Products/Services: Defining the area of operations is necessary to get an idea of what services are offered by the company. Explain the type of products or services which the company provides to its customers. Clearly explain if it provides only products/only services or both. For example, salons are service companies as they give different services like haircuts to their customers whereas grocery stores are product-oriented as they provide only products to the customers. Explain how this is beneficial for the customers. If customers avail the service or buy the product then what are the advantages of using that product or service? Hence, clearly state the main areas of business. 
Articulate Mission and Vision: In addition, talk about the company's mission and vision. A mission statement is a brief description of the purpose of the company which highlights its goals, culture, and values. It helps other stakeholders to have a clear picture of the top priorities of the company. Vision statement is where the organization views itself in the long run. It explains the long-term goals of the company and what it wants to achieve in the next five to ten years. It depicts what the company would look like in the future. 
Introduce Team: The team includes all the people who are involved in the organization from day one. Write short notes on the founders and include the following things- 
●	Name 
●	Qualifications 
●	Mission behind establishing the company
Also, include the people who have co-founded the company. Talk about various departments which are there in the company and their team leaders. Highlight the roles of managers of the respective teams. This will give the audience an idea as to how the company operates under different divisions. 
Include Contact Information: Contact information is necessary so that one can talk personally to get additional information if required. Add the address of the company. Mention the email ID and phone number of the company. Lastly, add your team leader’s name, email, and phone number so that it is easy to communicate and get inputs frequently. 
Write concisely and clearly, keeping the language simple and accessible. Always make sure to make your document clear and to the point. Try avoiding additional points that are unnecessary. Keep it short and crisp so that it is easier to read and review for the person who is viewing the document. Avoid using ambiguous language, use simple words to make the language easier to comprehend. 
In conclusion, while preparing the document, add all the details of the company which you think is important. State it clearly and make sure it is factually correct. Keep your document simple, concise and relevant.

 4: Review and Revision
Review and Revision are two important tools for documentation. Documentation Review can discover gaps and weaknesses that can lead to missing or improperly implemented security controls. I like to refer to the 4Cs for review, these are clear, concise, Coherent, and Correct. Regular policy review and Revision are important parts of every policy and procedure management plan. Effective policies and procedures including the manual as a whole, are living documents that must grow and adopt a company. 
4.1.  Review the content for accuracy, clarity, and consistency
Clarity refers to the quality of being easy to understand. Your content should be clear and concise. It's free from jargon or confusing language. Always avoid using long, complex sentences or technical terms unless they are necessary. Certain points should be followed when you maintain accuracy such as 
●	Know Your Audience and purposes 
●	Research and verify your research 
●	Use tools and research 
●	Seek feedback and proofread
4.2 Revise as needed to improve readability and effectiveness.
Increasing readability means Increasing the document's functionality in terms of content and document Design. In general, keep words, sentences, and paragraphs short. Remove redundant information and keep short paragraphs. 
4.3 Ask for feedback from the team 
Feedback is a crucial tool for development. It helps to improve and develop the company. Collaborative writing tools like Google Docs make collaborating and giving feedback easy. These are some points to follow when asking for feedback. 
●	Specify what you need feedback on. Are you looking for overall impressions, specific critiques, or suggestions for improvement in certain areas?
●	Make the purpose and audience clear. 
●	Highlight particular sections or elements where you need input. This helps reviewers focus on relevant areas and provide targeted feedback.
●	Set a reasonable deadline for receiving feedback. This ensures that reviewers have enough time to provide thoughtful input while keeping the project on track.

Employee feedback has a holistic impact on any company. Documentation review is a process where the document goes through one or multiple stages of review. The outcome of the document review process is that it enhances the accuracy and quality of the document.

 5: Formatting and Design
A good format and design for your documentation are important to effectively convey the intended information. Here are some useful tips for the same. 

●	Clarity in Design: Choose a design that is simple, clear as well as professional. Make sure enough white space around text and images so that the design doesn’t look cluttered and unclear to the reader. Make sure that the color themes that are used for documentation are appealing to the reader. 
●	Headings, Subheadings & Bullet points: Organize your content with clear headings and subheadings which improves readability and makes it easier to navigate through the content. Use bullet points to break down information and make it easier to understand. 
●	Text Formatting: Use appropriate fonts like Ariel and Times New Roman. Ideal font size can be 10-12 pt for the body while headings can have a slightly higher size. To highlight key points, use Bold, Italics or Underline. Also, make sure to adjust the spacing between paragraphs to make it look uniform. Ensure that there is consistent formatting throughout the document.   
●	Visual Elements: Visually appealing elements like diagrams or illustrations can also be added as references to enhance understanding. 
________________________________________
6: Finalization and FEEDBACK 
Finalizing your document as well as gathering feedback is a crucial step of documentation. 
Tips for Finalisation 
●	Make sure that all necessary topics are covered in your document. Crosscheck it with your outline to ensure you haven’t missed anything. 
●	Check the accuracy of the facts and technical details to make sure you are up-to-date and avoid misrepresentation. 
●	Ensure that you have maintained consistency throughout the document in formatting, style, layout, etc.
●	After this, proofread the entire document for grammatical errors, typos or any last-minute edits and make necessary corrections. 
Feedback
●	Select individuals like your seniors, peers, or well-wishers who can give you valuable feedback.  
●	Review feedback objectively and make changes where required. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, effective documentation is key to making a strong impression during interviews. By understanding your audience, conducting thorough research, and presenting information in a clear and structured manner, you demonstrate professionalism and preparedness. As you move forward, keep these principles in mind to create compelling and impactful documents. With this, we’ll end Day 6.
