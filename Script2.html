5.  DOS AND DON’TS

Understanding the dos and don'ts of resume writing is crucial because your resume is the first point of contact with potential employers. Knowing what to include and how to present your information effectively ensures that your resume highlights your strengths, relevant skills, and accomplishments clearly and compellingly. 

DOS

 • Determine your job search objective before writing the resume and tailor your resume for the position.
Defining your job search objective is crucial before crafting your resume. This targeted approach makes your resume more compelling to recruiters and increases your chances of landing interviews. This tailored resume showcases how your background aligns with the requirements and responsibilities of the specific job you're pursuing.

 • Customize your resume to match a specific job description. Use buzzwords from the industry.
Most of the Hiring Managers these days use tools to filter through resumes using keywords from the job description. Tailoring your resume using the job description will improve your chances of getting your resume noticed. Read the job description and note significant keywords related to skills. These may be words or phrases that seem unique to the job throughout the posting. Then take note of specific requirements, such as necessary education or training and years of experience.

Buzzwords are important because they help you match your resume to the job description, which is often scanned by software or recruiters for relevant terms. By using the same or similar words as the employer, you increase your chances of passing the initial screening and getting an interview. 

 Look for keywords and phrases that are frequently used, emphasized, or valued in your field, such as technical skills, certifications, methodologies, or trends. Also, look for words that describe the company's mission, vision, values, or goals, and how they align with your own. Finally, look for words that reflect the specific requirements, responsibilities, and expectations of the role, such as competencies, outcomes, or challenges.

While buzzwords can be beneficial for your resume, they can also backfire if used incorrectly or excessively. Avoid generic, vague, and overused words like "hard-working", "team player", or "results-oriented". Additionally, stay away from outdated, irrelevant, or misleading words such as "synergy", "dynamic", or "guru". 

• Focus on positive results and accomplishments.
Positive outcomes are what recruiters are hoping to get by hiring someone. Describe the outcomes of your actions rather than just listing your duties. Wherever possible, use numbers to quantify your accomplishments. Focus on highlighting positive results and accomplishments in your resume to make a stronger case for your application and demonstrate your ability to contribute effectively to potential employers. 


 • Keep a consistent, easily readable format.
Set proper margins for your document to ensure the information fits within a highly readable space on the page. You are also required to make sure to left-align your resume so it is easy to read. If appropriate and readable, you might decide to centre-align certain section headers to stylise your resume.

When deciding what font to use for your resume, keep in mind that it is clear and easy to read.

Using bullet points in your experience, skills, education or achievement sections allows employers to easily pick the most relevant pieces of information from your background. 

 • Create strong, action-oriented statements about your work. 
To ensure that your resume stands out and gets you noticed, it's important to present your skills and accomplishments in a way that speaks to the impact that you have made in your present and previous roles. One, very effective way of doing this is to create an action-oriented resume. Rather than simply providing a list of your past responsibilities, an action-oriented resume highlights your successes and the actions you took to achieve them. 

Replacing present-tense words with a strong verb will help the reader feel the impact of your actions.
Remember to use concise action-oriented bullet points that begin with impact verbs, quantify when you can, and tailor your resume to highlight your skills and accomplishments that are in line with the role and the company culture you are applying for. 

DON’TS

 • Using templates and tables included in the software.
A resume template doesn't showcase your unique skills and experience, it is a huge waste of time when you could be using that time to customize your resume. It produces only a small variety of resumes which means that they look more or less identical.

Using complex tables in your resume could interfere with the way an ATS(applicant tracking system) reads your resume. This might cause your resume to be rejected by the system, even if you are a qualified candidate for the job. Ensuring your resume matches the job description and uses simple formatting is key.

 • Making general claims (“Good communication skills”) without backing them up with examples.
Without examples, the claim remains abstract and subjective.  General claims without evidence may not be taken seriously or trusted by others. Providing examples gives credibility to your assertion and demonstrates real-world application.


 • Misleading employers about your GPA, skills, or abilities.
Never lie about your GPA. An employer may request a transcript to confirm the number you use, and if you lie, you’ll harm your reputation, and sometimes you may even face legal issues.  Also, never round your GPA up or down. Put the exact GPA as it is on your transcript.

Don't mislead employers about your skills or abilities. If you get hired based on false information, you may struggle to perform in the role. This can lead to poor performance reviews, disciplinary actions, or even termination.


•Including long, generic objective statements. 
Employers won’t read them
Including a long, generic objective statement in a resume is an outdated and ineffective practice, considered useless because they are vague and could apply to almost any job seeker. They typically don't provide any specific information about your skills, experiences, or career goals and waste the limited space which could’ve been utilised better. Employers are more interested in how you can meet their needs and contribute to their organization rather than reading a statement about what you hope to gain from the job.

 • Submitting references on the same page as your resume. 
They should be kept in a separate document and provided when the employer asks for them.
Professional references are a list of contacts you provide to employers to enable them to learn more about you and your past work. Employers value references because they can get a third-party opinion on the value you’ll bring to their team if hired.
It's wise to hold off on providing your references until they are explicitly requested during the hiring process. By waiting until you are asked for references, you can inform your references beforehand. This gives them a heads-up that they may be contacted soon, allowing them to prepare and be ready to highlight relevant skills and experiences that align with the job you're applying for. This preparation can significantly enhance their effectiveness in supporting your application.

 7. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CV AND RESUME

Now that we have a better understanding of how to build a resume let’s look at another similar term that we are familiar with, CV or Curriculum vitae. Whether you’re seeking a position in a corporate company or any other industry, knowing which document to use and how to structure it can significantly impact your job search success.

Let's start with the resume. 

Resume 

A resume is a concise document, typically no longer than two pages, that emphasizes your skills and professional experience. It's primarily used when applying for positions in industry, non-profit organizations, and the public sector.

The goal of a resume is to quickly showcase your abilities and achievements to potential employers. If you have a year or more of industry experience, it's advisable to start with your work experience and place the educational qualifications towards the end. A typical resume is in the following order: Contact Information, Summary or Objective, Skills, Work Experience, Education, and Additional Sections such as Certifications or Volunteer Work.

Skills are a crucial component of a resume. Emphasize your core capabilities and tailor them to the job you are applying for. Use bullet points for clarity and make sure to include both hard and soft skills that are relevant to the position. Focus on your achievements and contributions in previous roles. Use quantifiable metrics where possible to demonstrate your impact.


Now, let's understand the curriculum vitae or CV. 

CV

A CV emphasizes your academic accomplishments and is used when applying for positions in academia, fellowships, and grants. 

Contrary to a Resume, a CV typically begins with your education and includes the degrees you’ve earned, the institutions you attended, your advisors, and a summary of your dissertation if applicable. It's important to provide detailed information about your academic accomplishments. This includes a full list of your publications, academic appointments, presentations, awards, conferences you’ve attended, research projects you’ve been involved in, and any other relevant academic achievements. Be thorough and precise.

A CV is not restricted by length. Its length depends on your experience and can span several pages. It should provide a complete picture of your academic journey, from your educational background to your latest research projects. Include all relevant details to give prospective employers or grant committees a comprehensive view of your qualifications.


In short, a resume is a concise document used to highlight skills and professional experience for industry roles. It is typically no longer than two pages. Whereas a CV is a detailed record of academic accomplishments used for academic positions, fellowships, and grants, and can be as long as necessary to include all relevant information.

8. Applicant Tracking System(ATS)

In today's digital age, job searching has evolved significantly, with Applicant Tracking Systems, or simply ATS, playing a pivotal role. Being an active job seeker you might have come across the term ATS at least once or twice. In this module, we’ll try to understand what ATS is and why it holds such significance in the hiring process.  

a)	Understanding ATS

Applicant Tracking Systems are software applications used by employers to simplify the hiring process. They automate the initial screening process, scanning and ranking resumes based on specific keywords, formatting, and their relevance to the job description. By doing so, ATS helps employers filter through large volumes of applications, quickly identifying the most suitable candidates. For job seekers, understanding how ATS works is crucial, as optimizing resumes for ATS compatibility can significantly improve the chances of getting noticed and advancing to the next stage of the hiring process.

b)	How ATS Works

There are four major stages of ATS that one must know to understand how this sophisticated software works.

First, Resume Submission and Parsing: When a candidate submits a resume through a job portal or company website, the ATS first parses the document. Parsing involves breaking down the resume into recognizable sections such as contact information, work experience, education, and skills. The system converts the resume into a standardized format, extracting relevant data for further processing.

Second, Keyword Matching: ATS is programmed to search for specific keywords and phrases relevant to the job description. Employers configure the ATS to prioritize these keywords, like job titles, skills, certifications, and other relevant terms. The system scans the parsed resume for these keywords, determining how well the candidate’s qualifications match the job requirements.

The third stage, Ranking Algorithms: Based on the presence and frequency of keywords, as well as the overall relevance to the job description, the ATS assigns a score to each resume. This ranking algorithm considers various factors, such as the context in which keywords appear, the formatting of the resume, and the length of employment at previous jobs. Resumes that score higher are considered more relevant and are more likely to be reviewed by human recruiters.

Finally, Filtering and Shortlisting: After scoring, the ATS filters out resumes that do not meet the minimum threshold set by the employer. The system creates a shortlist of the most qualified candidates, presenting them to the hiring manager for further review. This helps reduce the workload on HR personnel, allowing them to focus on interviewing and evaluating top candidates.

This process ensures that only the most relevant candidates make it through to the next stage, thereby saving time and resources for employers and providing a more streamlined experience for applicants.

c)	Format Layout for ATS Compatibility

Creating a resume that is compatible with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) involves using a clean and straightforward format. Avoid using complex formatting elements like tables, graphics, or columns, which can confuse the parsing software. Stick to standard sans serif fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica and use font sizes between 10 and 12 points for readability. Clearly label each section of your resume with conventional headings such as "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills," ensuring that these headings stand out. Use bullet points to list achievements and responsibilities, as they are easier for ATS to process than dense paragraphs of text. 

d)	Keywords for ATS Optimization

Optimizing your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) requires the strategic use of keywords. Focus on incorporating relevant terms from the job description, such as specific skills, job titles, and industry. Use exact phrases and variations to cover all possible keyword matches. Place these keywords naturally throughout your resume, particularly in sections like "Work Experience," "Skills," and "Education." 

e)	Avoid These Mistakes

Using Headers or Footers: Important information placed in these areas might be overlooked by the ATS which may result in important information being missed. So, Keep all essential details within the main body of your resume.

Inconsistent Resume File Format: To ensure compatibility with different ATS systems, use a widely accepted file format like .docx or .pdf. This helps maintain the integrity of your resume's formatting and content.

Using Abbreviations or Acronyms Without Spelling Them Out: ATS may not recognize abbreviations or acronyms. Always spell them out at least once, followed by the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses. For example, "Master of Business Administration (MBA).

f)	Must Do

Clearly Label Each Section of Your Resume: Use conventional headings such as "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills" to ensure the ATS can easily identify each section of your resume.

Follow a Standardized Order of Sections: Arrange your resume in a logical and standardized order, typically starting with Contact Information, followed by a Summary or Objective, Work Experience, Education, Skills, and Additional Sections such as Certifications or Volunteer Work. This structure helps the ATS and human readers navigate your resume efficiently.

g)	Additional Tips

For further understanding, let's compare two resumes: one with an ATS score below 50 and another with a score above 80.

We see that the low-scoring resume lacks a skills section near the top, uses abbreviations, and omits relevant job titles and company names. Whereas the high-scoring resume includes a skills section near the top, avoids abbreviations, and lists relevant job titles and company names."

Optimising your resume according to ATS is crucial in today's job market. Following these tips, and strategies will enhance your resume and increase your chances of getting noticed by employers, in turn making you move closer to your career goals.
